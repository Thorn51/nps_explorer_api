# National Park Explorer API

The National Park Explorer API was developed as a capstone project in the Thinkful Engineering Flex program.

## Summary

This API was created to serve the [National Park Explorer client](https://github.com/Thorn51/nps_explorer_client). The API provides services to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. A summary of the endpoints and example of data can be found below.

The API is deployed to Heroku.

## Authorization

All of the endpoints in the National Park Explorer API are routed through authorization middleware. The first level of authorization requires a basic token. At this point, there is no mechanism in place to generate and share API tokens for use with the API.

The second level of authorization middleware creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) after a successful login. All endpoints below will indicate the type of authorization required to successfully perform CRUD operations on the database.
